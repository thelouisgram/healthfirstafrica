## 🛠 Maintenance

### Adding Pictures and Videos

To update the gallery with new content, follow these steps:

1.  **Upload Assets**:
    - Place your new image or video files in the `public/assets/` directory.
    - _Tip_: Use consistent naming or descriptive names (e.g., `community-outreach-2026.jpg`).

2.  **Update the Gallery Page**:
    - Open `src/app/gallery/page.tsx`.
    - Locate the `galleryItems` array at the top of the file.
    - Add a new entry for your asset:
      ```javascript
      { type: "image", src: "/assets/your-new-image.jpg" },
      // OR for videos
      { type: "video", src: "/assets/your-new-video.mp4" },
      ```

3.  **Update the Homepage Gallery (Optional)**:
    - If you want to feature new images on the home page, open `src/app/components/Gallery.tsx`.
    - Update the `featuredImages` array with the paths to your new assets.

### Requirements for Images

- **Format**: Use `.jpg` or `.png` for photos and `.mp4` for videos.
- **Ratio**: The gallery uses an `aspect-[4/3]` ratio (Landscape). Images will be automatically cropped to fit this ratio, so try to use landscape-oriented photos for the best results.
